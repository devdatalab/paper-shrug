       by the SHRUG, for all states and union territories in
       India. Population numbers are reported in

    \scriptsize \textit{Note}: Table~\ref{tab:sae_decomp_rural} presents a
    comparison of IHDS and SECC covariates that were used to generate
    per capita consumption small area estimates in the rural
    SHRUG. The IHDS and SECC columns indicate the value for each
    covariate in the SECC and IHDS surveys taken at the village level;
    because the SECC is a census, no weights were required, while the
    IHDS required the use of sampling weights. Column 3 presents the
    difference between the two. Column 4 shows the coefficient for
    each covariate when regressing per capita consumption on the set
    of covariates in the IHDS. Column 5 multiplies column 4 by column
    3, representing the expected difference in per capita consumption
    between IHDS and SHRUG that is explained by that covariate. The
    omitted category for roof and wall materials was ``other.''

  \footnotesize \textit{Source}: Authors' analysis based on data in the \href{http://www.devdatalab.org/shrug}{Socioeconomic High-resolution
    Rural-Urban Geographic Dataset on India}. \\
  \footnotesize \textit{Note}: Table~\ref{tab:nl_xc_controls} shows the partial
  correlation between rural luminosity and population, employment,
  electricity, and consumption. Each estimate is from a separate
  cross-sectional regression of Equation~1, with added
  controls for all the other variables in the table. Each entry also
  controls the number of 1km x 1km cells in the geographic
  unit. Column 1 aggregates data to the district level, Column 2 to
  the subdistrict level, and Columns 3 and 4 to the village
  level. Columns 2-4 are clustered at the district level. The table is
  comparable to Table~3, but is rural only and has additional controls
  for the other outcome variables in the table.

  \footnotesize \textit{Note}: Table~\ref{tab:nl_ts_app1} shows the time series
  relationship between a set of rural development outcomes and
  night-time luminosity at the village level. Columns 1 and 2 restrict
  the data sample to 2001--2013. Columns 3 and 4 weight regressions by
  village population. Otherwise, estimates are similar to Columns 3
  and 4 in Table~4. All variables are measured in
  logs. All regressions include village fixed effects and are
  clustered at the district level.

      Figure~\ref{fig:impute_error} shows the mean absolute deviation
      of simulated estimates of constitutency population as compared
      with actual constituency population, under scenarios where we
      set a different share of the population to missing. We run a
      simulation where before calculating constituency population, we
      drop village and town observations representing X\% of
      constituency population, and then use our imputation
      methodology. The graph shows, for instance, that when we drop
      20\% of the data before imputation, our average constituency has
      a total population error of approximately 1.8\%. Panel B shows
      the signed error rather than the absolute error, indicating a
      very small downward bias in population estimation from our
      method.}
